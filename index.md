## Work CAN be fun.

Hi, I typed this greeting with the help of a cloud editor. It's amazing to think there was a time I could work only from my mac. These days, I'm spending more and more time exploring tech tools that will support my aspirations to work remotely and maintain sites wherever and whenever. Work CAN be fun.

And building this site is fun. These pages are a series of explorations into the latest web practices and utilities. To see more, please have a look at some of my finished projects on the [ portfolio ](/portfolio.html) page. Incidently, these sites have been maintained, at times, right from my phone.
