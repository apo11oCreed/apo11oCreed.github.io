### GA then GTM, now AMP

I read an interesting article recently on the imprisoning effects of proprietary custom element implementations [Custom Elements: an ecosystem still being worked out](https://paul.kinlan.me/custom-elements-ecosystem/). It got me thinking about how developers have evolved through practice and testing of cutting edge tech.

Developers are all moving so fast to learn the latest frameworks and languages, but take they should take a minute to look at how easily these things have been provided.

There are so many options and they are all fun to learn - I almost committed to Polymer. Not the worst idea, but I think frameworks require a level of loyalty that could be dangerous in the long term.

So here I am, working on making this site AMPlified on top of all of the Cloudflare optimizations. Can't wait to see the thunderbolt badge in my site search results. Google again owns my interest:p
