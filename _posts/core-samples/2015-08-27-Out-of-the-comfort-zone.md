## Not a Rant

If you run your own kitchen, how long did it take to make it YOURS? An invaluable characteristic of what makes an environment YOURS is every aspect that supports the way you like to work.

For the past two days, I have been removed from all of my keyboard custom shortcuts and workflow apps. To exist without any preferences or customizations - I do not wish that on anyone. To whom it befalls, I say unto you - be strong!
